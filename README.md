# European-CO2-emissions
The aim of this project is to create a dashboard about historical GHG emissions in the EU-28 (2018) with target reductions decided by the EU. The projects aims to clarify, which are the current reduction target goals. User may playaround with different emissions sources (energy, transport etc.) and see which combinations of emission reductions will lead to targets set.
